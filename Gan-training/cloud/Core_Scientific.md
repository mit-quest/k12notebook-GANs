# Getting started on the Core Scientific GPU Cloud

Core Scientific is a company focused on Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence hosting, transaction processing and application development. They provide an on-demand AI (GPU-accelerated) cloud service that makes deep learning experiments significantly faster, easier and less expensive to design, deploy and run. Their NVIDIA DGX-Ready data center means you will have convenient access to some of deep learning's most coveted GPUs, such as the 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs.

### Requirements:
- GitHub acocunt. If you don't have one, you can easily create a free account [here](https://github.com/).

To get started, you should directly contact Core Scientific by filling out his [form](https://www.corescientific.com/artificial-intelligence#form-section). Once you have devised a personalized solution, navigate to https://ailab.corescientific.com, where you will be greeted by a host of preconfigured GPU container images. Since we are using PyTorch in this tutorial, select the Tensorflow/PyTorch based container.

That's it! You'll now have access to a cloud based Jupyter-Lab (Notebooks, Terminals, etc.) with common software libraries preconfigured.
