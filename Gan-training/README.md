# GAN Training Tutorial Setup

This tutorial can be cloned via

```
git clone https://github.com/alexandonian/ganocracy.git
```

If you do not have git installed on your local machine, you can download the repo as a ZIP file with

```
wget https://github.com/alexandonian/ganocracy/archive/master.zip
```

### Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or greater.
- PyTorch 1.1 (LTS). Detailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
- torchvision 0.3.0. **Note**: Version 0.3.0 was just announced on May 23, 2019, so existing installations may need updating.
- tqdm, numpy, scipy, pandas, and h5py
- moviepy (optional)

**Step 1: Download Anaconda** If your system does not already meet these requirements, we recommend downloading the Anaconda Distribution of Python 3. Anaconda comes with the package manager `conda` (installation instructions can be found [here](http://ganocracy.csail.mit.edu/tutorial/setup.html)),  which makes installing PyTorch and other dependencies much easier.

**Step 2 (optional): Create `conda` environment** After installing `conda`, you can create an environment for this project to manage dependencies:

```
# Create a conda environment called 'gantraining'
conda create --name gantraining

# To activate this environment, use:
conda activate gantraining
```

**Step 3: Install PyTorch and dependencies:**
	
Installing the latest version of PyTorch and torchvision can be done in a single line:

```	
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```
and the dependencies with:
	
```
conda install h5py pandas
pip install tqdm moviepy
```

### Starting the Jupyter Notebook
	
**Locally:** You can start the tutorial notebook from the repository (`ganocracy`) you cloned or downloaded via:
	
```
cd gan_training
jupyter notebook
```
A browser window should automatically open, and you can run the notebook `Training.ipynb`
	
**Remotely with SSH Port-Forwarding:** If you are fortunate to have access to a headless remote server, ideally with several GPUs, it is possible to run the notebook on the server and still view it locally on your personal machine via ssh port-forwarding. Feel free to read more about ssh port-forwarding on your own, but it's not necessary for this tutorial.
 
 Using port forwarding to view Juypter notebooks on a remote server requires two steps:
 
1. **On the REMOTE machine**: Start the jupyter notebook as normal. You may need to include the `--no-browser` option:
    ```
    cd tutorial
    jupyter notebook --no-browser
    ```
    Jupyter notebook will display a bunch of information, which should include something like:
    ```
    [I 18:20:18.770 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/?token=MY_TOKEN
    [I 18:20:18.770 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
    [C 18:20:18.771 NotebookApp]
    
        Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
        to login with a token:
            http://localhost:8888/?token=MY_TOKEN
    ```
    
    Make note of the port number and token. In this case, we have `REMOTE_PORT=8888`

2. **On the LOCAL machine:** Decide which port you want to use to view the notebook. Choose anything in the range 1024-49151  (unreserved "user" ports). Call the port forwarding command:

    ```
    LOCAL_PORT=8888
    REMOTE_PORT=8888  # From step 1.
    
    ssh -fNL $LOCAL_PORT:localhost:$REMOTE_PORT $REMOTE_IP_ADDR
    ```
    In your browser, navigate to `localhost:$LOCAL_PORT`. If you are prompted, enter your token from step 1. You should now be able to see your jupyter notebooks running on the remote server.
    
    Finally, run the notebook `Training.ipynb`
